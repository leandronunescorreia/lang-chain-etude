Many studies have led to an under-\\nstanding of the potential mechanisms of action of pharmaceutically active components contained in food that may improve\\nhealth and reduce the risk of pathological conditions while enhancing overall well-being. Nevertheless, there is a lack of clear\\ninformation and, often, the claimed health beneﬁts may not be properly substantiated by safety and efﬁcacy information or\\nin vitro and in vivo data, which can induce false expectations and miss the target for a product to be effective, as claimed. An of-\\nﬁcially shared and accepted deﬁnition of nutraceuticals is still missing, as nutraceuticals are mostly referred to as pharma-foods, a\\npowerful toolbox to be used beyond the diet but before the drugs to prevent and treat pathological conditions, such as in subjects\\nwho may not yet be eligible for conventional pharmaceutical therapy. Hence, it is of utmost importance to have a proper and\\nunequivocal deﬁnition of nutraceuticals and shared regulations. It also seems wise to assess the safety, mechanism of action and\\nefﬁcacy of nutraceuticals with clinical data.

This overlap becomes even\\nwider when we consider functional foods and nutraceuticals.\\nWhat could be considered a functional food under a given set\\nof circumstances may be named a dietary supplement,\\nmedical food, food for special dietary use or nutraceutical\\nunder different circumstances, depending on its ingredients\\n(active components) and the claims reported on its label [1].\\nWhile the deﬁnition of a food supplement is quite clear\\nand understandable (see Table 1), the deﬁnition of a\\nnutraceutical is still in the grey area between food, food\\nsupplements and pharmaceuticals. The term nutraceutical, a\\nsyncretic neologism of the words nutrient and pharmaceutical,\\nwas originally coined by Stephen DeFelice, who deﬁned\\nnutraceuticals as “food or part of a food that provides medical\\nor health beneﬁts, including the prevention and/or treat-\\nment of a disease” [2]. This concept has been proposed as\\na modern approach to food science, and the area of possi-\\nble use has been deﬁned as beyond the diet, but before the\\ndrugs [3, 4]. Notwithstanding this concept, the deﬁnition\\nof nutraceuticals and a legitimate assessment of their\\npotential in medicine are still contradictory and far from\\nbeing shared and accepted worldwide [5].\\nThe nutraceutical deﬁnition often overlaps with the\\naccepted deﬁnition of food supplements [6, 7], and the\\nrationale behind the use of these products is becoming\\nmore and more important in their distinction.\\nNutraceuticals are continuously developed and have\\nquickly spread worldwide [8]. Existing contradictory infor-\\nmation in the ﬁeld is generating confusion about the possible\\neffective use of these products, which are available on the\\nmarket and in pharmacies. Food supplements, as per their\\nmicronutrient content, can be used to improve the health\\nof individuals in need. In general, many of the health claims\\nthat are currently associated with food supplements, pro- and\\nprebiotics, herbal products, and functional foods may not\\nproperly be substantiated by scientiﬁc data on their safety,\\nefﬁcacy and effect on health and/or pathological conditions.\\nThe claims are mainly unsubstantiated due to a lack of\\nstudies on possible mechanisms of action and a lack of\\nin vivo research conﬁrming the claimed beneﬁcial health\\neffects on speciﬁc pathological conditions. Another key\\naspect is related to the data reported in the literature, which\\nmainly comes from in vitro studies focused on single food\\nconstituents (micronutrients); these studies are based on the\\nassumption that micronutrients can be considered safe (or\\ngenerally recognized as so) because they are derived from\\ncommonly used food or food components [8, 9]. Safety is of\\nutmost importance, as there is also the possibility of\\ncontaminants of inorganic and organic origins in these\\nproducts [10, 11]. Moreover, the ingredients themselves may\\ncause health problems, and proper information on possible\\nunwanted side effects should be provided on the label. From\\nour point of view, it is imperative to have more information\\non safety and efﬁcacy based on clinical studies rather than\\nonly in vitro studies, and it is also important to reach a better\\nunderstanding of the mechanism of action and bioavailabil-\\nity of these products. The ﬁrst step in assessing the action of\\nnutraceuticals is to distinguish them from the other food-\\nderived products, particularly food supplements, which are\\nnot always included in daily dietary habits in the presence of\\na speciﬁc need [12].\\nThis exercise may require: (i) appropriate target identiﬁca-\\ntion; (ii) safety assessment; (iii) a clear understanding of the\\nmechanism of action; (iv) efﬁcacy assessment substantiated\\nby clinical studies; (v) an evaluation of possible unwanted\\nside effects; and (vi) an evaluation of possible interactions\\nwith other products (e.g. food, food supplements and drugs).'),\n",

An outline of the lack\\nof shared regulations regarding nutraceuticals as pharma-\\nfoods is needed [13]; nutraceuticals are considered to be in\\nthe grey area after diet, but before drugs. Therefore, it is\\nimportant to clearly identify their speciﬁcity in view of their\\npossible use and utility in the pharmaceutical arena.\\nState of the art and future trends\\nThe ﬁrst step in food regulation in Europe was established in\\n1997 with the Green Paper on Food Law, and it was followed\\nby the White Paper on Food Safety in 2000, which outlined\\nthe need for new and improved legislation in the ﬁeld [14].\\nThese papers led to the General Food Law Regulation [Regula-\\ntion (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of\\nthe Council 2002], which established the principle and\\nforesaw the creation of an independent organization called\\nthe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with the speciﬁc\\ntask\\nof\\ngiving\\nscientiﬁc\\nadvice\\nbased\\nupon\\nscientiﬁc\\nassessment of the beneﬁcial health effects and associated risks\\nrelated to food intake [15].\\nThe\\nEFSA mission\\nalso includes\\nfood\\nsupplements,\\nwhereas the responsibility for risk management and commu-\\nnication was taken on by the European Commission and\\nParliament. The risk assessment and risk evaluation can also\\nbe included as a part of the EFSA mandate if it follows a\\nspeciﬁc request made by the European Commission and\\nParliament from a European Member State or stakeholder.\\nThis step should then be followed by speciﬁc action from\\nlocal national authorities, who take the suggestions on board\\nand propose appropriate legislation and regulation in the\\nﬁeld. The mission of the EFSA is to “provide the basis for the\\nassurance of a high level of protection of human health and\\nconsumer interest in relation to food, considering the\\ndiversity\\nin\\nthe\\nsupply\\nof\\nfood,\\nincluding\\ntraditional\\nproducts, while ensuring the effective functioning of the\\ninternal market. It establishes common principles and\\nresponsibilities, the means to provide a strong science base,\\nefﬁcient organizational arrangements and procedures to un-\\nderpin decision-making in matters of food and feed safety.”\\nThis statement applies to all foodstuffs, and these general\\nprinciples also cover foods with added functional properties\\n(e.g. functional foods, food supplements, herbal products,\\nA.

    "In short, the Refine method for text summarization with LLMs can pull in more relevant context and may be less lossy than Map Reduce. However, it requires many more calls to the LLM than Stuffing, and these calls are not independent, meaning they cannot be parallelized. Additionally, there is some potential dependency on the ordering of the documents. Latest documents they might become more relevant as this method suffers from recency bias."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you learn about different techniques to summarize long documents with LangChain and PaLM API. What you have seen in this notebook are only some of the possibilities you have. For example, there is another method called the Map-Rerank method which involves running an initial prompt on each chunk of data, which not only tries to complete a task but also gives a score for how certain it is in its answer. The responses are then ranked according to this score, and the highest score is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, it is important to highlight that depending on your needs you may consider to use pure Foundational model with a custom framework to build generative ai application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the benefits of using a foundational model with a custom framework:\n",
    "\n",
    " - More flexibility to implement your application with different LLMs, prompting templates, document handling strategies and more.\n",
    "\n",
    " - More control to customize your generative applications based on your scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Better performance to improve latency and scalability of your application.\n"
