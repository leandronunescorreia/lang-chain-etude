      "of Effort Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA) frameworks. The TPB provided insights into\n",
      "how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence individuals’ intentions\n",
      "to consume fitness supplements. Additionally, the HBM sheds light on perceived effectiveness,\n",
      "benefits, barriers, and health motivation related to supplement consumption. Integrating the TEMPA\n",
      "framework further investigated the role of effort minimization in physical activity contexts. Through\n",
      "an online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\n",
      "respondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\n",
      "attitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\n",
